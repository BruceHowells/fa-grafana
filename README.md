# fa-grafana
Docker Grafana based metrics for PiAware receivers

This repo contains setup for a Docker application that utilizes Grafana, Prometheus, and a fork of [Claws's dump1090-exporter](https://github.com/claws/dump1090-exporter) Docker images to display dump1090-fa metrics for your PiAware device.

For now, this is intended to run on top of an existing PiAware setup and could potentially be included in a future official SD card release.
